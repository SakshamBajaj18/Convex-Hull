  <h1>KIRK-PATRICK SEIDEL ALGORITHM</h1>

  <div class="introduction">
    <p>The Kirk-Patrick Seidel Algorithm is a computational geometry algorithm used to find the convex hull of a set of points in the plane. The convex hull is the smallest possible convex polygon that encloses all points in the given set. It is also called Prune-and-Search algorithm.</p>
    
    </div>

    <h2 id="introduction">WORKING OF THE ALGORITHM</h2>
    
    <div class = "introduction">
        <p>The basic idea of the KPS algorithm is a type of reversal of the divide-and-conquer algorithm for convex hulls. This algorithm tells us to divide the problem into subproblems, solve the subproblems, and finally merge the subsolutions.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><u>Finding Median of Medians:</u> First step is to find median of x-coordinate of points, and dividing the point set into two halves using this median.</li>
            <li><u>Finding Convex Hull edges:</u> Determine which convex hull edges that intersect the vertical line that the median x-coordinate defines. Finding convex hull edges requires linear time.
            </li>
            <li><u>Discard the non-contributing points:</u> Delete the points that do not influence the formation of convex hull edges, i.e., that are not contributing to the convex hull edges, both on the left and right side of the dividing line. </li>
            <li><u>Recursive Computation:</u> Execute separate recursions for the top and lower halves of the convex hull. Points below the bridge edge vertically should be discarded in the recursion for the upper hull, while the points above the bridge edge vertically should be discarded in the recursion for the lower hull.
            </li>
            <li><u>Repeating Recursion:</u> Keep going through the recursive procedure, until the convex hull of the full collection of points is obtained.</li>  
        </ol>

        <p>Finally, it can be said that the Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm begins by dividing the input points based on the median x-coordinate. It then identifies convex hull edges intersecting the median-defined vertical line, discards non-contributing points, and proceeds recursively with remaining points. Recursion is separately performed for upper and lower hulls, discarding points accordingly. This process is repeated until the entire convex hull is obtained.

        </p>

    <h2 id="introduction">RUNNING TIME ANALYSIS</h2>
    <div class = "introduction">
        <p>The time complexity breakdown of the Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm is as follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><u>Best Case Time Complexity:</u> The best case time complexity occurs when the input points are already sorted. In this case, the sorting step would take O(n) time, and the overall time complexity would be dominated by the construction of convex hulls, which still takes O(n log h) time due to the construction of convex layers.</li>
          <li><u>Worst Case Time Complexity: </u>  The worst case time complexity occurs when the input points are such that each recursive step in constructing the convex hull creates a single convex layer, resulting in log h layers. In this case, the time complexity is again O(n log h) due to the construction of convex hulls.
          </li>
        </ol>
          
        <p>Thus it can be summarized as follows:</p>
        
        <ul id="introduction">
            <li>Time Complexity = <b>O(nlogh)</b>, where n: total number of points, h: number of points on the convex hull</li>
            <li>Best Case Time Complexity = <b>O(nlogh)</b></li>
            <li>Worst Case Time Complexity = <b>O(nlogh)</b></li>
        </ul>

    <h2 id="introduction">BREAKING DOWN THE TIME COMPLEXITY</h2>
    <div class="introduction">
        <p>Here is a detailed breakdown of the time complexity analysis of Kirk-Patrick Seidel Algorithm</p>
        <ul id = "introduction">
          <ol>
            <li>Preprocessing (Sorting and Building Upper and Lower Hulls): The algorithm first sorts the input points based on their x-coordinates (or some other criteria) which takes O(n log h) time. </li>
            <li>Then it builds the upper and lower convex hulls separately. Building each hull takes O(n) time. Thus, the total preprocessing time is O(n log h). </li>
            <li>Constructing the Final Convex Hull: The algorithm recursively partitions the points into smaller subsets and constructs convex layers. This process is similar to the merge step in merge sort. The recursion depth is logarithmic, so each layer can be constructed in O(n) time.</li> 
            <li>Since there are log h layers, the total time complexity for constructing the final convex hull is O(n log h). Therefore, the overall time complexity of the Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm is O(n log h).</li> 
          </ol> 
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- <h2 id="introduction">OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
    <div class="introduction">
        <ul id="introduction">
            <li>Jarvis March is a relatively simple algorithm to understand and implement.</li>
            <li>It performs well when the number of points in the hull is small compared to the total number of points.</li>
            <li>However, other algorithms like Graham scan have better overall time complexity <b>(O(nlogn))</b> for most cases.</li>
            <li>Jarvis march is considered an output-sensitive algorithm, meaning its efficiency depends on the size of the output (number of hull points).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Overall, Jarvis March offers a good balance between simplicity and efficiency for specific scenarios where the number of hull points is expected to be small.</p>

    <h2 id="introduction">CONCLUSION</h2>
    <div class="introduction">
        <p>In conclusion, determining the convex hull of a set of points in the plane can be done quite well with the help of the Kirkpatrick-Seidel algorithm. The method achieves an O(n log h) time complexity by using a divide-and-conquer technique and taking use of convex hull features. Here, n represents the number of input points and h denotes the number of points on the convex hull. The Kirkpatrick-Seidel method offers a strong and dependable solution for convex hull calculation through careful point management throughout the recursive process, including median-based splitting, eliminating non-contributing points, and merging upper and lower hulls. Because of its effective performance, it is the go-to option for many applications in computational geometry and related domains.</p>
